                    <p>May 6, 2018 - The Prudential Center - Newark, New Jersey In the WWE's first official PPV since WrestleMania
                        34, the stakes couldn't be any higher! Both RAW & SmackDown competed seperately on what was a huge
                        and lengthy show...</p>

                    <H6>BAYLEY VS. RUBY RIOTT (PRE-SHOW)</H6>

                    <p>Overall - Sloppy</p>

                    <p>The crowd was still more into this than a usual Pre-show match because they were into Bayley. Predictable
                        finish as Bayley speared Liv Morgan off the apron to the floor, but then Riott kicked Bayley and
                        then gave her the Riott kick for the pin. Riott kicked out of the Randy Savage elbow a few minutes
                        earlier.
                    </p>

                    <p>Result - Ruby Riott wins via pinfall (10:10).</p>

                    <h6>SETH ROLLINS (C) VS. THE MIZ FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                    <p>Overall - A great match.</p>

                    <p>This is a hot crowd. They were into it at the start and were up for all the big spots. Rollins was selling
                        his knee after doing a knee into the post. Miz hit the skull crushing finale twice and both times
                        Rollins kicked out. Miz continued to work on the knee. Miz tried a skull crushing finale off the
                        middle rope but Rollins escaped.</p>

                    <p>After a series of reversals, Rollins hit the curb stomp for the pin.</p>

                    <p>Result - Seth Rollins wins via pinfall (20:30).</p>

                    <h6>NIA JAX VS. ALEXA BLISS FOR THE RAW WOMEN'S TITLE</h6>

                    <p>Overall - Not much to this.</p>

                    <p> Unlike the first match of theirs which I enjoyed, this didn't have the same intensity.</p>

                    <p>The biggest spot in the match was Bliss giving Nia a DDT on the ring steps.</p>

                    <p>The finish saw Bliss go for twisted bliss with Jax catching her in mid-air and gave her a Samoan drop
                        for the pin. Jax did an in-ring interview after. The crowd was booing her slightly but mostly not
                        interested. Jax said this is for everyone who has been bullied, a few people clapped but most were
                        disintererested.She said it's okay to be different. These buzz words were about bullying were dying.
                        She said if you're good enough you should never change for a friend of a boyfriend. I don't think
                        they expected this reaction to her. She said a bully always gets her ass kicked. There was a little
                        reaction. Then Michael Cole went off on all the anti-bullying rallies they did. This came off so
                        contrived.
                    </p>

                    <p>Result - Nia Jax wins via pinfall (10:20).</p>

                    <h6>TO THE BACK!</h6>

                    <p>Samoa Joe did an interivew. He said Roman Reigns lost his confidence, a little speed, a little power
                        and a lot of determination. Tonight he loses to me. Of course the crowd is cheering Joe. Tonight
                        he turns the Big Dog into whimpeing puppy.
                    </p>

                    <h6>JEFF HARDY (C) VS. RANDY ORTON FOR THE U.S. TITLE</h6>

                    <p>Overall - Randy Orton strikes again...</p>

                    <p>I hate to say that every Randy Orton match these days is the same, but in this case it most certainly
                        was on the side of dull... Hardy won almost out of nowhere with a twist of fate and a "Heavy" Swanton.
                        Hardy landed really heavy on him. Nobody expected the finish so clean or that early. Orton always
                        technically good, just perhaps a lack of investment in this months latest feud.</p>

                    <p>Result - Jeff Hardy wins via pinfall (12:00).</p>

                    <H6>Musical interlued</H6>

                    <p>Elias was out. Given they were in the New York market, he got cheered heavily. He said he was good friends
                        with Bruce Springsteen. Said Springsteen calls him "The Boss." He said the only thing Springsteen
                        regrets is that he's from New Jersey. He didn't get that much heat for it. Too predictable. He said
                        he was going to leave. Then he didn't. Then he teased it again. Then he stayed. Then he teased it
                        again. The New Day came out. Big E came out with a drum from a marchinng band while Woods had a green
                        trombone. Woods said they wanted to Walk with Elias. He said he was solo act. This was probably five
                        minutes long but it felt longer than every Okada vs. Tanahashi match combined. Elias said that maybe
                        some day they can open for Elias but this isn't that day. Then Aiden English came out. Fans did react
                        big to him chanting "Rusev Day." Did they promise the Saudis another personal show and a 30 minute
                        prayer break? Rusev came out. Rusev called him Bootleeg Bob Dylan. JoJo introduced Elias and then
                        No Way Jose came out. Titus was in the Conga line as was Apollo Crews, Tyler Breeze, Dana Brooke,
                        Bo Dallas and Fandango. Bobby Roode showed up and laid him out with a DDT. The crowd reacted big
                        to Roode. English wanted to join the Conga line as they all left and Rusev got mad at him.
                    </p>

                    <h6>DANIEL BRYAN VS. BIG CASS </h6>

                    <p>Quick match. Even then Cass was slow on offense. It was a big win by Bryan who gave him a high kick and
                        then put him in the LeBell lock. Cass tapped right away. Cass then attacked him after the match.
                        Cass gave him two biel throws on the floor while the crowd chanted "You tapped out." Cass laid him
                        out after with a running kick.</p>

                    <p>Result - Daniel Bryan wins via pinfall (7:45).</p>


                    <h6>CARMELLA VS. CHARLOTTE FLAIR (C) FOR SMACKDOWN WOMEN'S TITLE</h6>

                    <p>This was bad. It was painfuly obvious that whie Carmella is a good talker, in the ring she's like the
                        women from 10-15 years ago. This was hard to watch because it had to be athletially dumbed down since
                        Carmella took most of the match. Charlotte missed a moonsault and sold her her left knee buckled.
                        Carmella kicked Charlotte in the hamstring and rolled her up.</p>

                    <p>Result - Carmella wins via pinfall (9:00).</p>

                    <H6>A.J.STYLES (C) VS. SHINSUKE NAKAMURA IN A NO DQ MATCH FOR THE WWE TITLE</H6>

                    <p>So the reason they couldn't put this on last was because they did a finish where both guys kicked each
                        other low at the same time and neither guy could get the ten count so it was a no contest. They were
                        having a very good match up until that point. Earlier in the match Nakamura used a low blow and then
                        Styles came back with a low blow. A key spot is that when Nakamura went for the Kinshasa, Styles
                        grabbed a chair that Nakamura had brought into the ring. Styles threw the chair at the knee and it
                        nailed Nakamura's world and then the chair bounced off Nakamura's knee and nailed Styles on the left
                        cheekbone. Styles was bleeding badly. It didn't play into the rest of the match at all. It added
                        drama to the match but when it was over, it was yet another disappointing match. Really aside from
                        Rollins vs. Miz, this has been a really bad show.</p>

                    <p>Result - No contest (21:05).</p>


                    <H6>BRAUN STROWMAN & BOBBY LASHLEY VS. KEVIN OWENS & SAMI ZAYN</H6>

                    <p>What a mess. The match ended with Zayn trying to run away but Owens puleld him back in. They aruged and
                        Zayn eventually slapped Owens. Zayn walked off and Lashley pinned Owens after a delayed vertical
                        suplex. After the match the idea was that Zayn was still there and he was yelling at Strowman and
                        Lashley but wouldn't help Owens in the ring and they powerslammed him. Zayn went to leave but Strowman
                        ran him down and poweslammed him. There was no reaction to this. They managed to take one of their
                        hottest crowds of the year and gave them such a good show that they didn't even react to Strowman's
                        big move.</p>

                    <p>Result - Braun Strowman and Bobby Lashley win via pinfall (8:40).</p>

                    <H6>ROMAN REIGNS VS. SAMOA JOE</H6>

                    <p>They brawled before the match. Then there was an endless neck twist and chin lock. It started off boring
                        and the crowd hated it, chanting boring, chanting for Punk, lots of people were leaving. It did get
                        better and turned into a normal WWE style match with stars, working around their signaure spots.
                        Reigns hit a spear but Joe made the ropes. Joe did an elbow suicida. They traded near falls and then
                        Reigns hit a spear and pinned him. People didn't really care that much. They did react at the end
                        but by no means was this a good match.</p>

                    <p>Result - Roman Reigns wins via pinfall (18:10).</p>
