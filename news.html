                <p>May 6, 2018 - The Prudential Center - Newark, New Jersey In the WWE's first official PPV since WrestleMania
                    34, the stakes couldn't be any higher! Both RAW & SmackDown competed seperately on what was a huge and
                    lengthy show...</p>

                <H6>BAYLEY VS. RUBY RIOTT (PRE-SHOW)</H6>

                <p>Overall - Sloppy</p>

                <p>The crowd was still more into this than a usual Pre-show match because they were into Bayley. Predictable
                    finish as Bayley speared Liv Morgan off the apron to the floor, but then Riott kicked Bayley and then
                    gave her the Riott kick for the pin. Riott kicked out of the Randy Savage elbow a few minutes earlier.
                </p>

                <p>Result - Ruby Riott wins via pinfall (10:10).</p>

                <h6>SETH ROLLINS (C) VS. THE MIZ FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                <p>Overall - A great match.</p>

                <p>This is a hot crowd. They were into it at the start and were up for all the big spots. Rollins was selling
                    his knee after doing a knee into the post. Miz hit the skull crushing finale twice and both times Rollins
                    kicked out. Miz continued to work on the knee. Miz tried a skull crushing finale off the middle rope
                    but Rollins escaped.</p>

                <p>After a series of reversals, Rollins hit the curb stomp for the pin.</p>

                <p>Result - Seth Rollins wins via pinfall (20:30).</p>

                <H6>JOHN CENA VS. TRIPLE H</H6>

                <p>Overall - Solid match.</p>

                <p>There were parts where moves and execution looked wonky, but for the most part this was very well laid out
                    and ending up having a great opening match. They started things slow, with a test of strength and a few
                    shoulder blocks. Triple H gained control until Cena stopped him as he tried to whip Cena into the corner
                    but Triple H locked him in a sleeper. Triple H went for a pedigree, but Cena escaped and hit the blue
                    thunder bomb. Cena went for the five knuckle shuffle but Hunter hit a suplex and crotch chopped Cena
                    for good measure. Hunter went for the pedigree but Cena threw him into the turnbuckle where he landed
                    on the floor hard. Cena jumped off the of tope but Hunter grabbed him in midair and hit a powerbomb.
                    Cena fights back and takes Hunter down with the STF. Hunter fired back with a spinebuster and mounted
                    him with punches on the top rope. Cena grabbed him, took him down and hit the blue thunder bomb and a
                    five knuckle shuffle. Cena followed with the AA, but Hunter kicked out. Cena went for another AA but
                    Triple H countered with a pedigree for another near fall. Cena went for a second AA, but Hunter kicked
                    out. Cena immediately transitioned to the STF again but Hunter countered with a crossface. Cena, using
                    his strength, deadlifted him for an AA, slingshotted Hunter into the corner then hit another AA for the
                    win. Cena took the mic after the match. He said it was an honor to be here and wouldnâ€™t miss anything
                    in the world for this. He thanked the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their well being and everyone in the
                    building for making something special tonight.</p>

                <p>Result - John Cena wins via pinfall (15:45).</p>

                <H6>CEDRIC ALEXANDER (C) VS. KALISTO FOR THE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP</H6>

                <p>Overall - Great match</p>

                <p>Kalisto is incredible with his offense and looked great throughout the bout. Crowd was into the high spots,
                    but not so much into the match. Things started off with a hot exchange, with Kalisto getting the upper
                    hand. He took Alexander out of the ring and hit a springboard senton to the floor. Alexander countered
                    and, in the same situation, hit a tope con hilo on the outside, wiping out Kalisto. Alexander drilled
                    Kalisto with a dropkick, then settles things down with a bearhug. Kalisto escapes to the apron and hits
                    a crossbody, a seated hurricanrana and a tilt-a-whirl DDT. Alexander fired back with a Michinoku driver.
                    He went to the top rope but Kalisto kicked him in the temple. The two fought for a bit before Kalisto
                    planted Alexander with a springboard spanish fly. After a great exchange in the ring, Kalisto went for
                    the Salida del Sol but in midair Alexander countered and hit the lumbar check to retain the title.</p>

                <p>Result - Cedric Alexander wins via pinfall (10:15).</p>

                <h6>MATT HARDY & BRAY WYATT VS. CESARO & SHEAMUS FOR THE WWE RAW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS</h6>

                <p>Overall - Not great</p>

                <p>I guess calling it solid would suffice, but it wasnâ€™t a particularly interesting match. Things are kept even
                    early, though eventually the Bar gets the advantage and works over Hardy with frequent tags. Wyatt gets
                    the hot tag and clears house, wiping Sheamus with the Sister Abigail. He tags back in Hardy and they
                    hit their elevated twist of fate finish to win the titles.</p>

                <p>Result - Matt Hardy & Bray Wyatt win via pinfall (8:50).</p>

                <h6>JEFF HARDY (C) VS. JINDER MAHAL FOR THE WWE UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                <p>Overall - Not great</p>

                <p>This did not last long, clocking in as the second shortest match on the card. The match ranged from boring
                    to terrible and made their match on Raw previously look like a million bucks. Sunil Singh interfered
                    with the match almost from the get go, allowing Mahal to the heat and leverage. Hardy grabs Mahal for
                    a twist of fate attempt but Mahal escapes. Hardy counters with a clothesline. Hardy went for a whisper
                    in the wind and totally missed, but then Mahal took a bump anyway in a really bad botch. Singh jumps
                    on the apron and distracts Hardy long enough for Mahal to try for the Khallas, but Hardy escapes. He
                    hits the Twist of Fate and follows with the Swanton for the win.</p>

                <p>Result - Jeff Hardy wins via pinfall (6:10).</p>

                <p>They aired a video talking about Saudi Arabia's recent commitment to sports and entertainment ventures. Draw
                    your own conclusions. Videos with Chris Jericho and Daniel Bryan followed. It was weird with Jericho
                    because he did all the cues that people would normally react to, but no one reacted so it fell flat.</p>

                <h6>THE BLUDGEON BROTHERS (C) VS. THE USOS FOR THE WWE SMACKDOWN TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS</h6>

                <p>Overall - Ok</p>

                <p>Another short match. I think it worked better here between these teams as the Bludgeon Brothers have been
                    pushed as a dominant force on SmackDown, and the quick match here continued that. Bludgeons started off
                    strong, destroying Jey Uso early. Rowan hit a big splash and put Jey in a vice grip. Rowan hits the turnbuckle
                    but tags in Harper. Jey sends him packing quickly and tags in Jimmy, who takes out both Harper and Rowan
                    with dives. Jey is tagged back in as the Usos double team Harper. Jey hits a splash. Rowan on the outside
                    takes out Jimmy and Jey on the outside. Rowan throws Jey back in the ring and tags himself in as he hits
                    a big splash. Harper and Rowan then hit the killer bomb to retain.</p>

                <p>Result - The Bludgeon Brothers win via pinfall (6:10).</p>

                <h6>SETH ROLLINS (C) VS. SAMOA JOE VS. FINN BALOR VS. THE MIZ FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                <p>Overall - Great match</p>

                <p>This was great. Unlike in modern day WWE matches where there were ladders everywhere, there was only one
                    here and I really liked that. Everyone used the ladder for lots of great, impactful shots. Nothing absolutely
                    crazy, but definitely a great ladder match that the crowd was into. Rollins hit a double blockbuster
                    on Miz and Joe. Balor and Rollins went at it and hit a suicide dive on both sides of the ring. A ladder
                    is brought out as Miz and Rollins take out Joe, but Balor flies out of the ring with a tope con hilo
                    that wipes out both Rollins and Miz. Balor attacks Samoa Joe in the ring with the ladder. Rollins grabs
                    the ladder and sets it up. Balor climbs up with him, but Joe and Miz come in and shoves the ladder down,
                    sending them to the floor. Meanwhile, Miz wants to form an alliance with Samoa Joe, but he responds with
                    a headbutt. Joe sets up a ladder that falls to the floor as he goes to grab Balor, so instead Joe hits
                    an exploder. Balor fires back with a slingblade then dropkicks Joe into a ladder set up in the corner.
                    The ladder falls on Joe as Balor looks to go for the coup de grace. Everyone comes in and instead thereâ€™s
                    a tower of doom spot. Miz then hits Joe with the Skull Crushing Finale on the ladder. He goes to climb,
                    but Rollins meets him up there. Miz throws him down, but Balor immediately climbs up. Miz gets the better
                    of it and uses the ladder to beat everyone up. Balor makes a comeback, laying out Miz and hits a coup
                    de gras on Miz, who was on top of the ladder. Balor and Joe battle. After some great back and forth,
                    Joe lays him out with a uranage. Balor climbs the ladder, but Rollins springboards to the top of the
                    ladder and grabs it from under Balorâ€™s nose for the win in a great finish.
                </p>

                <p>Result - Seth Rollins wins via pinfall (15:05).</p>

                <p>The next segment introduced four WWE tryout participants which were all from Saudi Arabia: Nassar, Hussein,
                    Monsoour and Fisal. They were cutting promos in the middle of the ring to a huge reaction when Shawn
                    and Ariya Daivari came out. Shawn was waving the Iranian flag... Ariya cut a promo on all of them, calling
                    them trainees and wannabes and put over Iran. A brawl broke out with Shawn focused on Fisal, who then
                    retaliated. Hussein hit a powerslam on Shawn, then Nassar threw him out of the ring. This got over well
                    with the crowd, obviously. The main issue I think that will come out of this is that the WWE thought
                    it was a good idea to use a real life blood feud between two rival countries to get heat. I personally
                    think that they really should have just done a nice segment with the try out winners and leave the political
                    termoil that they may have stumbled into out of it.</p>


                <h6>AJ STYLES (C) VS. SHINSUKE NAKAMURA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                <P>Overall - Good until the finish</P>

                <P>I'll say this, this was definitely better than their WrestleMania bout and the crowd was hot for it, hotter
                    than any match up to this point. The finish however was lame, but itâ€™s clearly to set up a match for
                    Backlash so it makes sense. They start off slow. Nakamura targets Nakamuraâ€™s knee then takes him down
                    to the floor with a knee to the back of the head on the apron. Nakamura went for a reverse exploder but
                    Styles laid him out with an inverted spinebuster. Styles kips up and hits a splash. Styles tries for
                    the Styles clash but Nakamura made it to the ropes. Nakamura connects with a kick and looks to go for
                    the kinshasa but Styles cradles him. Styles counters a Nakamura charge into a calf crusher, but Nakamura
                    makes it to the ropes. He fights back setting up Styles in the corner and hitting a knee to the gut.
                    Nakamura takes Styles to the top rope, but Styles slides underneath and grabs the knee, taking him down.
                    After a hot back and forth, Nakamura captures Styles in an armbar but Styles counters with a cradle and
                    connects with a pele kick. Styles goes for the phenomenal forearm, but Nakamura moves out of the way.
                    Styles almost hits the referee, and in the confusion low blows Styles and rolls him up. Styles grabs
                    the ropes right before three. Styles and Nakamura go it to the outside, where they brawl into the announce
                    table and outside of the ring. The referee counts to ten, ending the match. Styles takes Nakamura over
                    the barricade and lays into Nakamura, throwing him back into the ring. Styles goes for the phenomenal
                    forearm, but Nakamura bails as Styles stands tall.
                </P>

                <p>Result - Double countout (14:25).</p>


                <h6>THE UNDERTAKER VS. RUSEV (WITH AIDEN ENGLISH)</h6>

                <P>Overall - Ok</P>

                <p>The Undertaker defeated Rusev in a casket match This was short, but longer than the Cena bout. It was okay,
                    but nothing noteworthy in terms of an actual match. It was what you would expect from a standard Undertaker
                    match these days. Rusev didnâ€™t like the casket being open and stalled before getting into the ring. Undertaker
                    worked him over. He did the rope walk spot and threw him on top of the casket. Rusev takes Undertaker
                    out of the ring and shoves him into a nearby barricade, but Undertaker fights back and hits a legdrop.
                    He rolls Rusev into the casket, but Aiden English distracts him. Rusev escapes and when Undertaker enters
                    the ring, takes him out with a big kick. The two trade punches as Rusev lays out The Undertaker. They
                    fire back with even more punches until Undertaker hits a chokeslam and throws Rusev into the casket.
                    English comes in and gets a chokeslam and the tombstone. He rolls English into the casket with Rusev
                    and closes it for the win.</p>


                <h6>BROCK LESNAR (C) VS. ROMAN REIGNS FOR THE WWE UNIVERSAL CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                <P>Overall - Ok</P>

                <p>Brock Lesnar defeated Roman Reigns to retain the Universal title This was better than their WrestleMania
                    bout. Still a lot of finisher spamming, but it wasnâ€™t a dull match. The finish was pretty damn lame.
                    This feud already felt dead the moment Brock pinned Roman at WrestleMania, and to possibly do a third
                    match between these three feels like unnecessary overkill. Not only do people not care about Roman Reigns,
                    but in storyline they really shouldnâ€™t care anyway because heâ€™s already lost to Lesnar twice. Lesnar
                    dominates early. He goes for the F5, but Reigns fires back with Superman punches. He goes for a spear
                    in the corner, but Lesnar grabs him. Reigns hops on the cage and tries to escape, but Lesnar grabs and
                    drags him back in. Lesnar tries to escape, but Reigns grabs him and plants him with a powerbomb. Back
                    in the ring, Reigns hits a spear, then a second, and a third. Heyman distracts Reigns and smacks him
                    with the open steel cage. Lesnar hits the F5, but Reigns kicks out. Heyman throws a chair in as Lesnar
                    takes off his gloves. As Lesnar looks to use the chair, Reigns hits another spear. He grabs the steel
                    chair and repeatedly strikes Lesnar, then follows with a Superman punch. Reigns hits another spear that
                    sends both men through the cage and to the floor. Lesnar hit the floor first, so Lesnar wins the match.</p>


                <h6>50 MAN ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH FOR THE WWE GREATEST ROYAL RUMBLE CHAMPIONSHIP</h6>

                <P>Overall - Good</P>

                <P>Before the match they announced a Nakamura/Styles rematch and Rollins vs. Miz for the Intercontinental title
                    for Backlash. This match featured a lot of filler... as you probably should expect from a roughly ninety
                    minute match featuring fifty wrestlers.</P>


                <P>DANIEL BRYAN and DOLPH ZIGGLER are number one and two, respectively. DOLPH came out to his record scratch
                    entrance music or lack of there of. SIN CARA follows at number three and lays out BRYAN with a swanton
                    bomb. ZIGGLER went for a zig zag, which Sin Cara blocks but Ziggler clotheslined him out of the ring
                    as a receipt. CURTIS AXEL came in at number four, with MARK HENRY entering as number five.</P>

                <P>HENRY eliminated AXEL as MIKE KANELLIS entered at number six, he was this Rumble's record breaker with HENRY
                    eliminating him in less than a breath. Number seven was HIROKI SUMI, a sumo wrestler... well we say a
                    sumo wrestler but he looked more just out of shape than anything. The story of this entrant was HIROKI
                    going toe to toe with HENRY, but for whatever reason after they do their intense stare down HENRY dumps
                    him out in short order. HIROKI and MARK were the first of many big men in this match, which I would say
                    was specifically for the Saudi audience and TV. As HENRY stares down at the fallen SUMI, BRYAN uses the
                    distraction to eliminate him from the match. VIKTOR was in at eight, he and BRYAN wrestled on the apron
                    for a bit before BRYAN took him out of the match. KOFI KINGSTON was number nine and ran wild early on.
                    TONY NESE was number ten (Surprising probably a lot of the people watching at home that they didn't use
                    TYE DILLINGER for this spot)</P>

                <P>DASH from the Revival was in at eleven, with HORNSWOGGLE in at twelve who helped to eliminate DASH. Amazingly
                    HORNSWOGGLE grabs KINGSTON and lays him out with a samoan drop... just for the sheer spectacle it's worth
                    a watch. He then heads up to the top rope for the "tadpole" splash but ZIGGLER connects with a superkick.
                    I'm not sure if at this stage if HORNSWOGGLE was meant to fly out of the ring, but he very gently climbs
                    down the turnbuckle. ZIGGLER heads over to finish him, but HORNSWOGGLE lays into him with a bite. As
                    ZIGGLER moves out of the way HORNSWOGGLE eats a big boot from NESE, to send him out of the match. PRIMO
                    COLON was in at thirteen, XAVIER WOODS at fourteen. PRIMO tried to eliminate KINGSTON, but KINGSTON grasps
                    onto XAVIERâ€™S shoulders and hangs on. They climb to the top rope and, using KINGSTON, WOODS launches
                    off with a clothesline, wiping out a few of the participants. BO DALLAS enters at fifteen,
                </P>

                <P>KURT ANGLE is sixteenth coming out to an absolutley massive pop from the Saudi crowd. ANGLE immediatley eliminates
                    DALLAS and PRIMO, with ZIGGLER trying to charge in but ANGLE belly to belly suplexes him to the floor
                    eliminating him. DAWSON is seventeen, GOLDUST eighteen and KONNOR at nineteen. ELIAS was number twenty,
                    playing the guitar. He was about to perform a song, but then saw an opportunity to eliminate not only
                    KONNOR but also both WOODS and KINGSTON.</P>

                <P>LUKE GALLOWS is number twenty one as ANGLE and BRYAN work with one another to control the ring. ANGLE hits
                    the Angle slam on GALLOWS, but as ANGLE gets up ELIAS sneaks up from behind and eliminates him. Twenty
                    two is RHYNO, twenty three is DREW GULAK. TUCKER KNIGHT from NXT is twenty four, GULAK trys to take KNIGHT
                    out with a dragon sleeper but Knight grabs him and throws him to the floor. BOBBY ROODE is out at twenty
                    five, he dropkicks GOLDUST out of the match and slingshots DAWSON out as well.
                </P>

                <P>FANDANGO is twenty six, CHAD GABLE is twenty seven. He lifts KNIGHT onto his shoulders and hits an electric
                    chair drop. REY MYSTERIO is out at twenty eight to an incredible pop from the crowd, he quickly eliminates
                    GALLOWS. MOJO RAWLEY is twenty nine quickly eliminating FANDANGO. TYLER BREEZE is number thirty. MOJO
                    meets him on the apron and tries to push him off, but he falls into FANDANGO's arms. He gets back up,
                    but MOJO shoves him again, eliminating him at last.</P>

                <P>BIG E is thirty one and he and KNIGHT go at it, E connects with the Big Ending eliminating him. KARL ANDERSON
                    is thirty two, APOLLO CREWS at thirty three, who eliminates GABLE. RODERICK STRONG from NXT is thirty
                    four, RANDY ORTON at in thirty five and runs roughshod on everyone, including planting Crews with an
                    RKO. He eliminates Crews, Rawley and Anderson. HEATH SLATER is thirty six. BABATUNDE from NXT is number
                    thirty seven, then BARON CORBIN, who eliminated Roode and Strong. TITUS Oâ€™NEIL ran to the ring at 38,
                    an in an amazing spot that can never be duplicated, somehow tripped and slipped all the way under the
                    ring. I am still trying to recover from that. DAN MATHA from NXT is thirty nine, but BRAUN STROWMAN at
                    forty comes in and eliminates the NXT guys and Heath Slater. TYE DILLINGER comes in at forty one as Strowman
                    eliminates Titus and Dillinger. Orton and Mysterio team up and take out Strowman. Corbin and Mysterio
                    battle it on the apron, but Corbin gets the better of it and eliminated him. Orton eliminates Corbin,
                    then Elias throws out Orton. CURT HAWKINS is forty three. He runs away from Strowman but gets pawed to
                    the floor. After taking out various people on the outside. Strowman eliminates Hawkins as BOBBY LASHLEY
                    enters at forty four. He and Elias go at it, with Lashley hitting a bad side slam then throws out Elias.
                    Lashley and Strowman tease as he takes out both of them. THE GREAT KHALI enters at forty five. He chops
                    some people, then is quickly dumped out by Lashley and Strowman, who then go at it. KEVIN OWENS is forty
                    six. At this point, Cole mentions has reached the record for the longest lasting participant in a Royal
                    Rumble in history. SHANE MCMAHON is in at forty seven as Owens focuses in on him. Shane lays him out,
                    leading to a showdown between him and Daniel Bryan, but instead they focus on Owens. SHELTON BENJAMIN
                    is number forty eight. Owens points out they have to get rid of Strowman as everyone focuses on him.
                    BIG CASS is number forty nine as Daniel Bryan motions for him to come in. Shane McMahon climbs to the
                    top rope and hits a giant coast to coast, sending Braun out of the ring. CHRIS JERICHO enters at fifty
                    as he zeroes in on Kevin Owens. He eliminates Benjamin as Bryan work on Owens. He tells Shane to get
                    to the corner as he goes for a coast to coast on Owens, but Strowman dashes to the apron, grabs him and
                    throws him into the announcers table, eliminating him. Strowman eliminates Jericho, Owens and Lashley.
                    Bryan tries to eliminate Strowman, but Cass jumps him and eliminates him after an hour and sixteen minutes,
                    leaving him and Strowman as the final two. Strowman crotches him then hits a giant shoulder block, eliminating
                    him and winning the Rumble. Vince McMahon and a Saudi official were in the ring. Strowman is given the
                    trophy and a championship title that was never mentioned on commentary. Fireworks display as the show
                    ends. I think overall the show was good, with some fun matches (opener, ladder match) and solid wrestling
                    overall. If i had to pick between this one and the January Rumble I'd easily say that the first one was
                    the better.</P>
